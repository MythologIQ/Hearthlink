# Hearthlink Phase 2 – Supplemental Document

## Overview

This supplemental document defines the critical enhancements, refinements, and testing requirements for Hearthlink Phase 2. These focus on centralized exception handling, comprehensive plugin and security verification, negative/edge-case testing, and user notification for risk. All updates are mapped against platinum blocker principles and the current state of delivery.

## Centralized Exception Logging

- All critical exceptions (not only Synapse) must be logged through a unified handler.
- Logs must capture:
    - Exception type, message, module, stack trace, and context
    - Timestamp, severity level, and user/session (if relevant)
- Audit logs remain exportable and must surface all critical error events.

---

## Dedicated Test Plugin

- Build a plugin for the sole purpose of exercising the plugin safety rails:
    - Manifest parsing/validation
    - Permission enforcement (positive and negative)
    - Sandboxing behavior (escapes, illegal ops, resource limits)
    - Audit event generation for every action (approved, denied, attempted)

---

## Negative & Edge-Case Testing

- Develop automated tests for:
    - Malformed plugin manifests and denied actions
    - Permission escalation attempts
    - Sandbox escape or resource overuse
    - Invalid, missing, or tampered audit logs
    - Simultaneous plugin executions, plugin failure/restart cycles

---

## User Notification Logic

- Implement real-time or session-based notification when:
    - A plugin is denied, fails, or triggers a high-severity alert
    - A sandbox escape or illegal operation is detected
    - Anomalous activity (from rules-based Sentry) is flagged
- UI integration, if any, must follow platinum accessibility and privacy requirements.

---

## QA Automation

- Ensure each platinum blocker (manifest, permissions, sandbox, audit, approval, risk) is covered by an automated test.
- Build a matrix to map each blocker to one or more negative/edge-case test scenarios.
- QA outcomes and regression reports must be logged and tracked for every sprint.

---

## Documentation & Traceability

- For every architectural or security enhancement, update:
    - `/docs/PLATINUM_BLOCKERS.md`
    - `For_consideration.md` (archive this doc upon completion)
    - `/docs/appendix_h_developer_qa_platinum_checklists.md`
- Maintain traceability between delivered code, tests, and the open items table above.

---

## Out of Scope (Phase 2)

- Multi-user support
- Full regulatory certification
- ML-based anomaly detection
- Major UI expansion/persona evolution

All are acknowledged as future opportunities and deferred by design.

---

## Next Steps

- Use this document to drive the next sequence of Cursor prompts and Issues.
- Review and update the open items table at each daily stand-up or sprint review.
