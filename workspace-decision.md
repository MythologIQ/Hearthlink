# Workspace Decision: Electron vs Tauri

## Current State
- Mixed Electron and Tauri configurations in single package.json
- Electron is the primary runtime (main entry: main.js)
- Tauri exists as secondary option with src-tauri/ directory
- Both have complete build configurations causing conflicts

## Recommendation: Keep Electron as Primary
Based on codebase analysis:

### Why Electron:
1. **Complete Integration**: main.js has 1500+ lines of Electron-specific logic
2. **Active Development**: All recent commits use Electron workflows
3. **Feature Rich**: Custom protocol handlers, IPC channels, multi-window support
4. **Production Ready**: Has complete build pipeline and distribution setup

### Why Remove Tauri:
1. **Incomplete Implementation**: Tauri config points to missing wrapper.html
2. **Minimal Usage**: Only 1 TypeScript hook file exists for Tauri
3. **Build Conflicts**: Duplicate bundling configs cause dependency bloat
4. **Maintenance Overhead**: Supporting both runtimes without clear benefit

## Implementation Plan:
1. Remove Tauri dependencies from package.json
2. Delete src-tauri/ directory 
3. Remove Tauri-related scripts
4. Keep useTauriIntegration.ts as stub for future consideration
5. Document decision in project README

This keeps the codebase focused while maintaining the door open for future Tauri adoption if needed.
