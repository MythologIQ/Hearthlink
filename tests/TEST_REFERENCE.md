# Test Reference Documentation

## Overview
This document provides traceability for all UI tests to their originating design prompts, audit line items, or sprint documentation. Test requirements are distributed across multiple source documents rather than centralized in a single test plan.

## Source Documents for Test Requirements
- **Test Planning Requirements**: `/docs/process_refinement.md`
- **Voice Functionality Tests**: `/docs/VOICE_ACCESS_POLICY.md`
- **UI Screen Validation**: `/docs/UI_ALIGNMENT_AUDIT.md`
- **Test Reference & Traceability**: `/docs/TEST_REFERENCE.md` (this document)

## Test Traceability Requirements
- All test files must include a comment or metadata block referencing:
  - Audit section
  - Feature ID (if any)
  - Policy docs (VOICE_ACCESS_POLICY, process_refinement)
- Central reporting: UI test results must be fed into central test pipeline
- Result logs stored in `/tests/results/ui/summary.json`

## Voice Policy Test Requirements
- **Source**: `/docs/VOICE_ACCESS_POLICY.md`
- **Requirements**:
  - Simulated voice interaction with trigger phrase, fallback handling, and agent confirmation
  - UI response must match expected routing behavior
  - Vault logging validation at API or mock layer
  - Voice handoff confirmation ("You're speaking withâ€¦") must be tested explicitly

## UI Test Success Criteria
- **Tier 1**: Same weight as error-handling tests
- **Pass Rate**: 100% pass required for merge
- **Edge Cases**: Negative cases must be present
- **JSON Logging**: Required where state/data is involved
- **Cross-Platform**: Windows 10 minimum, Ubuntu fallback validation

  - `tests/feature/ui-test-vault-logging/test_audit_trail.py`

## Test Infrastructure

### Environment Setup
- **File**: `tests/env/setup_ui_env.py`
- **Purpose**: Enforce UI test preconditions
- **Requirements**:
  - Fresh session state initialization
  - Logging to `/logs/tests/ui/` with timestamp
  - Resource monitoring for Voice/AI Agent interface tests

### Test Runner
- **File**: `tests/ui/runner_ui_tests.sh`
- **Purpose**: Unified test execution
- **Requirements**:
  - Same runner and report structure as Core/system tests
  - JSON format logging to `/tests/results`
  - Standalone job or integrated into nightly CI

### Central Reporting
- **File**: `/tests/results/ui/summary.json`
- **Purpose**: Centralized test results
- **Format**: JSON with test results, resource data, and environment info

## Commit Requirements

### Feature Branch Format
- All UI tests must be committed under `feature/ui-test-[module/scope]`
- Examples:
  - `feature/ui-test-voice-routing`
  - `feature/ui-test-agent-interaction`
  - `feature/ui-test-voice-interface`
  - `feature/ui-test-vault-logging`

### Commit Message Format
- Must include `UI_TEST`, feature ID (if applicable), and source of test directive
- Examples:
  - `UI_TEST: VOICE-001 - Voice routing compliance tests (Owner Directive)`
  - `UI_TEST: UI-001 - Agent interaction screen tests (Audit)`
  - `UI_TEST: VAULT-001 - Voice session logging tests (Policy)`

### QA Review Requirements
- Before merge, all test files must be peer-reviewed or verified via prompt from Owner
- All tests must link to originating design prompt, audit line item, or sprint doc

## Test Scope & Functional Depth

### Required Test Coverage
- **UI Presence**: Required
- **Functional Interactivity**: Required
- **Data Flow Validation**: Required where form or state update is expected
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Required for multi-agent screens

### Performance Requirements
- **Multi-Agent Screens**: Core Command Center, Vault Memory Manager
- **Voice Interface**: Real-time response validation
- **Resource Monitoring**: CPU, memory, disk usage tracking

## Test Execution Workflow

1. **Environment Setup**: Initialize fresh session state via `setup_ui_env.py`
2. **Resource Monitoring**: Start monitoring for Voice/AI Agent interface tests
3. **Test Execution**: Run tests with proper feature branch structure
4. **Result Logging**: Save results to `/tests/results/ui/` in JSON format
5. **Central Reporting**: Update `/tests/results/ui/summary.json`
6. **Cleanup**: Clean up test environment and temporary files
