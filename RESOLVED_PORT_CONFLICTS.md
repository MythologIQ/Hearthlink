# âœ… HEARTHLINK PORT CONFLICTS RESOLVED

## Problem Summary
React development server was failing to load due to port conflicts between multiple backend services competing for the same ports.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Service Orchestration
Created **`service_orchestrator.py`** - A unified service management system that:
- **Detects and kills conflicting processes** automatically
- **Manages port allocation** across all backend services
- **Provides health monitoring** and auto-restart capabilities  
- **Ensures clean service startup** in proper dependency order

### 2. Port Allocation Strategy
- **LLM API**: `localhost:8001` - Local LLM integration with Ollama
- **Alden Backend**: `localhost:8888` - Simple SQLite-based Alden service
- **Synapse API**: `localhost:8003` - Plugin management (auto-allocated)
- **React Dev Server**: `localhost:3015` - Frontend development server

### 3. Resolved Configuration
Updated React to use **port 3015** via `start:react-fixed` script to avoid conflicts.

## Current Working Status

### âœ… Backend Services (All Healthy)
```bash
# LLM API - Full Ollama integration
curl http://localhost:8001/api/status
# â†’ {"backend": "ollama", "circuit_breaker_status": "closed", ...}

# Alden Backend - SQLite database integration  
curl http://localhost:8888/status
# â†’ {"service": "simple-alden-backend", "status": "healthy", ...}

# Synapse API - Running on auto-allocated port
curl http://localhost:8003/status
# â†’ Plugin management service
```

### âœ… Frontend Service
```bash
# React Development Server
curl http://localhost:3015
# â†’ <title>Hearthlink - AI Orchestration Hub</title>
```

## Service Management Commands

### Start All Services
```bash
python3 service_orchestrator.py start
```

### Check Service Status  
```bash
python3 service_orchestrator.py status
```

### Clean Up Conflicts
```bash
python3 service_orchestrator.py clean
```

### Start React Development
```bash
npm run start:react-fixed  # Port 3015
# or
npm run dev:fixed         # React + Electron together
```

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Conflict Resolution**: Automatic detection and cleanup of port conflicts
2. **Health Monitoring**: Continuous service health checks with auto-restart
3. **Unified Management**: Single point of control for all backend services
4. **Dynamic Allocation**: Automatic port assignment when conflicts occur
5. **Clean Startup**: Proper dependency ordering and initialization

## Next Steps

With the port conflicts resolved, the application stack is now ready for:

1. **Full Multi-Agent Implementation** - Complete the conversation coordination system
2. **Frontend-Backend Integration** - Connect React UI to working backend APIs
3. **Session Management Testing** - Verify persistent conversation storage
4. **Voice Interface Integration** - Add voice routing and command processing

## Service URLs Summary

| Service | URL | Status | Purpose |
|---------|-----|--------|---------|
| React Dev | http://localhost:3015 | âœ… Running | Frontend UI |
| LLM API | http://localhost:8001 | âœ… Running | Ollama integration |
| Alden Backend | http://localhost:8888 | âœ… Running | SQLite persistence |
| Synapse API | http://localhost:8003 | âœ… Running | Plugin management |

**ðŸŽ¯ Priority resolved: React is now loading successfully with all backend services operational.**
