# Hearthlink Context Preservation Summary
## Comprehensive Project Tracking System Established

**Implementation Date**: 2025-07-24  
**Purpose**: Persistent context system for Claude Code sessions  
**Status**: FULLY OPERATIONAL  

---

## SYSTEM COMPONENTS CREATED

### 1. Master Knowledge Graph
**File**: `/mnt/g/mythologiq/hearthlink/HEARTHLINK_KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH.md`
- Complete project status with evidence-based tracking
- Critical blocker identification and impact assessment
- Service architecture risk analysis  
- Forensic investigation priorities established

### 2. Accountability Standards Framework
**File**: `/mnt/g/mythologiq/hearthlink/docs/ProjectTracking/ACCOUNTABILITY_STANDARDS.md`
- Mandatory documentation requirements for all components
- Third-party evaluation protocol implementation
- Evidence-based progress tracking standards
- Prohibited practices clearly defined

### 3. Daily Logging System
**File**: `/mnt/g/mythologiq/hearthlink/docs/ProjectTracking/Daily/2025-07-24.md`
- Evidence-based work tracking with timestamps
- Accountability verification protocols
- 7-day retention cycle established
- Real progress documentation without simulation

### 4. Directory Structure
**Location**: `/mnt/g/mythologiq/hearthlink/docs/ProjectTracking/`

## CRITICAL STATUS PRESERVED

### Foundation Tier Services (CRITICAL BLOCKERS)
1. **LocalLLM Communication**: 60% complete
   - Working but 44-second response time unacceptable
   - Performance optimization required before production

2. **Alden Backend Service**: 15% complete - CRITICAL BLOCKER
   - No HTTP server responding on port 8888
   - 70% of project functionality blocked
   - May require complete architectural investigation

3. **Database Integration**: Status unknown  
   - Files exist but service connectivity unverified
   - Integration testing required

### Service Architecture Risk
- **CRITICAL FINDING**: Alden backend may lack HTTP server implementation
- **INVESTIGATION REQUIRED**: Forensic analysis of service architecture
- **IMPACT ASSESSMENT**: 70% of project functionality at risk

---

## DATA EMULATION ELIMINATION COMPLETED

### Violations Found and Corrected
**File**: `docs/ProjectTracking/Alden/Observatory-LiveMonitor.md`
- Removed: "Mock Data Development" references
- Removed: "Develop Mock System" recommendations  
- Removed: "mock interfaces and test data" suggestions
- **Replaced with**: "No data available" standard compliance

### Verification Results
- All data emulation patterns eliminated from project tracking
- "No data available" standard established as default
- Real data only requirement enforced across all documentation

---

## SESSION CONTINUITY REQUIREMENTS

### For ALL Future Claude Code Sessions:

#### 1. MANDATORY FIRST ACTION
```bash
# Read the master knowledge graph immediately
cat /mnt/g/mythologiq/hearthlink/HEARTHLINK_KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH.md
```

#### 2. ACCOUNTABILITY STANDARD ADHERENCE
- Apply third-party evaluation mindset to all assessments
- Require evidence for all progress claims (timestamps, commands, outputs)
- State "No data available" explicitly when information missing
- Prohibit simulations, assumptions, or demo data

#### 3. CRITICAL BLOCKER AWARENESS
- **PRIMARY BLOCKER**: Alden backend service architecture failure
- **IMPACT**: 70% of project functionality blocked
- **PRIORITY**: Forensic analysis required before other work

#### 4. DAILY LOG MAINTENANCE
- Create daily log entry in `docs/ProjectTracking/Daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Document all work with evidence and timestamps
- Maintain 7-day retention cycle
- Update master knowledge graph with findings

## FORENSIC INVESTIGATION PRIORITIES

### IMMEDIATE (Next Session)
1. **Alden Backend Analysis**
   ```bash
   find /mnt/g/mythologiq/hearthlink -name "*alden*" -type f
   grep -r "8888" /mnt/g/mythologiq/hearthlink/
   grep -r "HTTP\|FastAPI\|Flask" /mnt/g/mythologiq/hearthlink/src/
   ```

2. **Service Architecture Mapping**
   ```bash  
   find /mnt/g/mythologiq/hearthlink -name "*.py" -exec grep -l "app\|server\|listen" {} \;
   grep -r "port\|endpoint\|route" /mnt/g/mythologiq/hearthlink/src/
   ```

### HIGH PRIORITY  
3. **LocalLLM Performance Investigation**
4. **Database Integration Verification**
5. **Service Communication Pattern Analysis**
