# Hearthlink Process Refinement – Living SOP

## Purpose

A living record of evolving standard operating procedures (SOP) for Hearthlink. Codifies modularity, traceability, review cycles, git hygiene, AI prompt discipline, and platinum-grade quality controls. All updates reflect lessons learned and continuous improvement.

---

## 1. Modular Development & Branching

* Major modules (Core, Vault, Synapse, etc.) are developed in dedicated branches (`feature/<module-name>`), created at work start.
* No direct commits to main; merges after QA/code review only.
* SOP enforced in documentation and prompts.

---

## 2. Remote Sync, Branch Management & SOP Enforcement

* All branches, commits, and tags are pushed to GitHub before merges.
* Missing branches are reconstructed and pushed as needed.
* Remote auditability is mandatory before implementation or release.
* Every correction/reconstruction is logged for traceability.

---

## 3. Regular GitHub Pushes & Versioning

* All work is committed and pushed to GitHub—never only at milestones.
* Semantic versioning (`vX.Y.Z`) and Issue/Sprint-linked commit messages.
* Pushing follows local implementation/testing of any branch.

---

## 4. Documentation & Traceability

* Every design/architecture change must be updated in system docs, blockers, supplements, or SOP.
* Issue → branch → commit → documentation update is strictly maintained.
* Open items tables track phase/feature enhancements.

---

## 5. README Hygiene: Single Root README Standard

* Only one authoritative `README.md` in the project root.
* Detailed module docs go in `/docs/` and are referenced in the README.
* All merges, audits, and onboarding check for README currency and singularity.

---

## 6. Documentation Enforcement in Prompts and Review

* Every prompt (manual or AI) must reference `/docs/` and system documentation.
* **MANDATORY:** Before any new development or planning, open `/docs/FEATURE_MAP.md` and cross-check every feature in current scope against prior documentation, phase plans, and system appendices.
* No branch or feature is "complete" until docs (including root README) are updated and cross-linked.
* Prompt templates always end with:

  > **Before proceeding:** Open `/docs/FEATURE_MAP.md` and cross-check every feature in current scope, planned for this phase, against prior documentation, phase plans, and system appendices. Flag any feature missing status, references, or implementation plan for immediate triage.
  > 
  > Reference the relevant `/docs/` for system and module specifics. Confirm all documentation updates before requesting review or merge.

---

## 7. AI/Agent Prompt Discipline

* Prompts to Cursor/AI reference documentation and blockers.
* Explicit instructions for branch, commit, and push.
* Intrusive/major suggestions require validation and explicit owner approval.
* Minor suggestions are auto-logged, reviewed at phase end.

---

## 8. Testing & QA Automation

* Negative/edge-case tests for every control and module before merging.
* Dedicated test plugin/module verifies plugin rails and audit features.
* QA checklists must be met before next phase advances.

---

## 9. Deferral & Scope Management

* Non-core/advanced features (multi-user, major ML, expanded personas) are deferred until the core is stable.
* No scope creep—future features cannot block/dilute platinum-grade foundation.

---

## 10. Phase-End Review & Approval Loop

* Features and design changes are reviewed at phase/sprint end.
* Urgent/architectural changes require validation prompt and explicit approval.
* All decisions, approvals, and rejections are logged with rationale.

---

## 11. Continuous Process Improvement

* Updated after every phase or process decision.
* Lessons learned, new requirements, and operational tweaks are captured here.

---

## 12. Lessons Learned & Further Refinement

### Key Lessons

* Process documentation prevents drift.
* Branching/modularity and regular pushing are non-negotiable.
* Prompt hygiene is project hygiene.
* Variance reports and approval loops are essential.
* Negative/edge-case QA is not optional.

### Next Phase Refinements

* Proactive import/dependency health checks.
* Mandatory documentation updates in every branch.
* Automated suggestion/improvement logging.
* Pre-merge owner review—always.
* Post-phase retrospectives.
* Blocker triage on critical issues.

## 13. Synapse Connection Integration SOP

* **All new Synapse connections (agents, plugins, APIs) are documented as supplements in `/docs/` using the Synapse Integration Template.**
* **Integration workflow:**

  1. *Design PRD/blueprint* in a new `/docs/SYNAPSE_<AGENT/PLUGIN>_SUPPLEMENT.md` file.
  2. *Reference the new integration in the root `README.md`* (see template below).
  3. *Cross-link* from the main Synapse blueprint to the supplement.
  4. *Implementation* occurs in its own feature branch: `feature/synapse-<agent/connection>`.
  5. *If new connection requires a custom setup/config wizard, document required steps, CLI/UI hooks, and post-merge checklist.*
  6. *Update Synapse's `config/connection_registry.json` (or equivalent) to recognize the new connection, supporting future dynamic discovery/UI setup.*
  7. *Full QA, docs, and process review before merge to main.*
* **A new connections wizard/config is recommended in Synapse's roadmap for all agent/plugin integrations.** (Planned for enhancement if not yet implemented.)

## 14. MCP Agent Resource Policy Implementation SOP

* **All agent resource access is governed by the MCP Resource Policy system.**
* **Zero-trust principle:** No agent is granted access to any resource (disk, network, workspace, memory, logs, plugins, external APIs) without explicit, scoped permission defined in policy.
* **Security controls are enforced for sensitive operations:** Encryption, sandboxing, timeout enforcement, risk assessment, audit logging, and violation handling are required for all privileged resource access.
* **Policy definitions for each major agent:**

  * *Sentry:* Security monitoring (disk, network, workspace, memory)
  * *Alden:* Workspace access, personal memory
  * *Alice:* Behavioral analysis (interaction logs, research)
  * *Mimic:* Persona generation (templates, knowledge)
  * *Core:* Session orchestration (session data, coordination)
  * *Vault:* Memory management (encrypted storage, backup)
  * *Synapse:* External gateway (plugins, APIs, sandboxed)
* **Policy engine implemented in `src/enterprise/mcp_resource_policy.py`**; see `/docs/MCP_AGENT_RESOURCE_POLICY.md` for documentation and examples.
* **Automatic audit logging for every access, with incident creation on violation.**
* **RBAC/ABAC integration and SIEM audit export supported.**
* **All policy updates require documentation in `/docs/MCP_AGENT_RESOURCE_POLICY.md` and cross-linking in process_refinement.md and README.md.**

---

## 15. Feature Wishlist Review and Prioritization SOP

* **All unimplemented or out-of-scope features are tracked in `/docs/FEATURE_WISHLIST.md`.**
* **Each wishlist item must have:**

  * Short requirements/specification
  * API and security considerations
  * Dependencies and prerequisites
  * Priority scoring (business value and complexity)
  * Proposed implementation phase/timeline
* **Features are prioritized by impact and resource requirements; high-priority features are scheduled for the next available phase.**
* **Backlog is reviewed at each phase start and end.**
* **Documentation and cross-referencing are required for any new feature added to the wishlist.**

---

## 16. Enhanced Documentation Standards & Cross-Referencing

* **All new documentation, features, and modules must be cross-referenced in README.md, process_refinement.md, and related supplemental docs.**
* **API design, security considerations, implementation notes, and dependencies must be documented for every feature.**
* **Comprehensive audit logging for all major decisions, merges, and releases is maintained in `/docs/` and reflected in main documentation.**

---

*Latest update: 2025-07-07 (Phase 8 test triage, comprehensive issue analysis, authoritative feature map creation, and all blockers, lessons, and recommendations for Phase 9 appended.)*

## 17. SOP Summary – Platinum Standard

* This document is the **authoritative, living SOP** for Hearthlink development.
* **All phases, workflows, and integrations** are cross-referenced here and in the root README.md.
* **No secondary README files or undocumented changes** are permitted—every enhancement, lesson, and branch must trace to this document or the main README.
* **SOP is updated after every phase, blocker, major review, or architectural decision.**
* **Process is dynamic and always improving—never static or final.**

*All contributors must review this SOP and the README.md prior to any new feature, branch, or merge. This is the platinum audit trail and quality standard for the entire project.*

---

## 19. Authoritative Feature Map Creation SOP

* **Purpose:** Create and maintain a comprehensive, authoritative feature map that extracts every feature mentioned across all system documentation.
* **Scope:** All features (primary, secondary, deferred, wishlist) mentioned in any system documentation.

**Primary Reference:** [`/docs/FEATURE_MAP.md`](./FEATURE_MAP.md) - **AUTHORITATIVE** inventory of all 49 system features

## 18. Installation UX & First-Run Experience SOP

* **Goal:** Installation and first launch of Hearthlink must feel intentional, welcoming, and delightful—less like installing software, more like opening a meaningful gift.
* **Design Standard:**

  * Installer and onboarding should be visually appealing, with animation or messaging that sets the tone (e.g., the metaphor of a helpful, wise puppy and kitten—clean, empathetic, competent companions).

* **QA Checklist Requirement:** All installation and first-run experiences must pass the comprehensive QA checklist in `/docs/ONBOARDING_QA_CHECKLIST.md` before release.
* **Quality Gates:** No feature is considered complete until the onboarding QA checklist is fully satisfied with stakeholder approval.
* **Cross-Reference:** See `/docs/FEATURE_WISHLIST.md` Section 0 for detailed specifications and requirements.
  * Onboarding includes a "meet your agents" sequence, introducing each core persona (Alden, Sentry, etc.) with brief role/feature highlights.
  * Immediate value is communicated—first-run actions (walkthrough, system check, config wizard) feel like supportive assistance, not technical setup.
  * Accessibility and user comfort are prioritized: gentle animation, voiceover/narration option, and onboarding step-skipping for advanced users.
* **Implementation/Process:**

  1. ✅ **COMPLETED:** Installation UX implemented in `src/installation_ux/` with comprehensive persona introductions, accessibility features, and configuration wizard.
  2. ✅ **COMPLETED:** Storyboard and technical specifications documented in `/docs/INSTALLATION_UX_STORYBOARD.md`.
  3. ✅ **COMPLETED:** Feature requirements and API specifications documented in `/docs/FEATURE_WISHLIST.md`.
