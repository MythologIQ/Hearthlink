# Hearthlink Process Refinement – Living SOP

## Purpose

A living record of evolving standard operating procedures (SOP) for Hearthlink. Codifies modularity, traceability, review cycles, git hygiene, AI prompt discipline, and comprehensive quality controls following all documented process standards and reference docs/process_refinement.md for the current standard operating procedures (SOP) and process requirements. All updates reflect lessons learned and continuous improvement.

---

## 1. Modular Development & Branching

* Major modules (Core, Vault, Synapse, etc.) are developed in dedicated branches (`feature/<module-name>`), created at work start.
* No direct commits to main; merges after QA/code review only.
* SOP enforced in documentation and prompts.

---

## 2. Remote Sync, Branch Management & SOP Enforcement

* All branches, commits, and tags are pushed to GitHub before merges.
* Missing branches are reconstructed and pushed as needed.
* Remote auditability is mandatory before implementation or release.
* Every correction/reconstruction is logged for traceability.

---

## 3. Regular GitHub Pushes & Versioning

* All work is committed and pushed to GitHub—never only at milestones.
* Semantic versioning (`vX.Y.Z`) and Issue/Sprint-linked commit messages.
* Pushing follows local implementation/testing of any branch.

---

## 4. Documentation & Traceability

* Every design/architecture change must be updated in system docs, blockers, supplements, or SOP.
* Issue → branch → commit → documentation update is strictly maintained.
* Open items tables track phase/feature enhancements.

---

## 5. README Hygiene: Single Root README Standard

* Only one authoritative `README.md` in the project root.
* Detailed module docs go in `/docs/` and are referenced in the README.
* All merges, audits, and onboarding check for README currency and singularity.

---

## 6. Documentation Enforcement in Prompts and Review

* Every prompt (manual or AI) must reference `/docs/` and system documentation.
* **MANDATORY:** Before any new development or planning, open `/docs/FEATURE_MAP.md` and cross-check every feature in current scope against prior documentation, phase plans, and system appendices.
* No branch or feature is "complete" until docs (including root README) are updated and cross-linked.
* Prompt templates always end with:

  > **Before proceeding:** Open `/docs/FEATURE_MAP.md` and cross-check every feature in current scope, planned for this phase, against prior documentation, phase plans, and system appendices. Flag any feature missing status, references, or implementation plan for immediate triage.
  > 
  > Reference the relevant `/docs/` for system and module specifics. Confirm all documentation updates before requesting review or merge.

---

## 7. AI/Agent Prompt Discipline

* Prompts to Cursor/AI reference documentation and blockers.
* Explicit instructions for branch, commit, and push.
* Intrusive/major suggestions require validation and explicit owner approval.
* Minor suggestions are auto-logged, reviewed at phase end.

---

## 8. Testing & QA Automation

* Negative/edge-case tests for every control and module before merging.
* Dedicated test plugin/module verifies plugin rails and audit features.
* QA checklists must be met before next phase advances.

---

## 9. Deferral & Scope Management

* Non-core/advanced features (multi-user, major ML, expanded personas) are deferred until the core is stable.
* No scope creep—future features cannot block/dilute comprehensive foundation following all documented process standards and reference docs/process_refinement.md for the current standard operating procedures (SOP) and process requirements.

---

## 10. Phase-End Review & Approval Loop

* Features and design changes are reviewed at phase/sprint end.
* Urgent/architectural changes require validation prompt and explicit approval.
* All decisions, approvals, and rejections are logged with rationale.

---

## 11. Continuous Process Improvement

* Updated after every phase or process decision.
* Lessons learned, new requirements, and operational tweaks are captured here.

---

## 12. Lessons Learned & Further Refinement

### Key Lessons

* Process documentation prevents drift.
* Branching/modularity and regular pushing are non-negotiable.
* Prompt hygiene is project hygiene.
* Variance reports and approval loops are essential.
* Negative/edge-case QA is not optional.

### Next Phase Refinements

* Proactive import/dependency health checks.
* Mandatory documentation updates in every branch.
* Automated suggestion/improvement logging.
* Pre-merge owner review—always.
* Post-phase retrospectives.
* Blocker triage on critical issues.

## 13. Synapse Connection Integration SOP

* **All new Synapse connections (agents, plugins, APIs) are documented as supplements in `/docs/` using the Synapse Integration Template.**
* **Integration workflow:**

  1. *Design PRD/blueprint* in a new `/docs/SYNAPSE_<AGENT/PLUGIN>_SUPPLEMENT.md` file.
  2. *Reference the new integration in the root `README.md`* (see template below).
  3. *Cross-link* from the main Synapse blueprint to the supplement.
  4. *Implementation* occurs in its own feature branch: `feature/synapse-<agent/connection>`.
  5. *If new connection requires a custom setup/config wizard, document required steps, CLI/UI hooks, and post-merge checklist.*
  6. *Update Synapse's `config/connection_registry.json` (or equivalent) to recognize the new connection, supporting future dynamic discovery/UI setup.*
  7. *Full QA, docs, and process review before merge to main.*
* **A new connections wizard/config is recommended in Synapse's roadmap for all agent/plugin integrations.** (Planned for enhancement if not yet implemented.)

## 14. MCP Agent Resource Policy Implementation SOP

* **All agent resource access is governed by the MCP Resource Policy system.**
* **Zero-trust principle:** No agent is granted access to any resource (disk, network, workspace, memory, logs, plugins, external APIs) without explicit, scoped permission defined in policy.
* **Security controls are enforced for sensitive operations:** Encryption, sandboxing, timeout enforcement, risk assessment, audit logging, and violation handling are required for all privileged resource access.
* **Policy definitions for each major agent:**

  * *Sentry:* Security monitoring (disk, network, workspace, memory)
  * *Alden:* Workspace access, personal memory
  * *Alice:* Behavioral analysis (interaction logs, research)
  * *Mimic:* Persona generation (templates, knowledge)
  * *Core:* Session orchestration (session data, coordination)
  * *Vault:* Memory management (encrypted storage, backup)
  * *Synapse:* External gateway (plugins, APIs, sandboxed)
* **Policy engine implemented in `src/enterprise/mcp_resource_policy.py`**; see `/docs/MCP_AGENT_RESOURCE_POLICY.md` for documentation and examples.
* **Automatic audit logging for every access, with incident creation on violation.**
* **RBAC/ABAC integration and SIEM audit export supported.**
* **All policy updates require documentation in `/docs/MCP_AGENT_RESOURCE_POLICY.md` and cross-linking in process_refinement.md and README.md.**

---

## 15. Feature Wishlist Review and Prioritization SOP

* **All unimplemented or out-of-scope features are tracked in `/docs/FEATURE_WISHLIST.md`.**
* **Each wishlist item must have:**

  * Short requirements/specification
  * API and security considerations
  * Dependencies and prerequisites
  * Priority scoring (business value and complexity)
  * Proposed implementation phase/timeline
* **Features are prioritized by impact and resource requirements; high-priority features are scheduled for the next available phase.**
* **Backlog is reviewed at each phase start and end.**
* **Documentation and cross-referencing are required for any new feature added to the wishlist.**

---

## 16. Enhanced Documentation Standards & Cross-Referencing

* **All new documentation, features, and modules must be cross-referenced in README.md, process_refinement.md, and related supplemental docs.**
* **API design, security considerations, implementation notes, and dependencies must be documented for every feature.**
* **Comprehensive audit logging for all major decisions, merges, and releases is maintained in `/docs/` and reflected in main documentation.**

---

*Latest update: 2025-07-07 (Phase 8 test triage, comprehensive issue analysis, authoritative feature map creation, and all blockers, lessons, and recommendations for Phase 9 appended.)*

## 17. SOP Summary – Platinum Standard

* This document is the **authoritative, living SOP** for Hearthlink development.
* **All phases, workflows, and integrations** are cross-referenced here and in the root README.md.
* **No secondary README files or undocumented changes** are permitted—every enhancement, lesson, and branch must trace to this document or the main README.
* **SOP is updated after every phase, blocker, major review, or architectural decision.**
* **Process is dynamic and always improving—never static or final.**

*All contributors must review this SOP and the README.md prior to any new feature, branch, or merge. This is the comprehensive audit trail and quality standard for the entire project following all documented process standards and reference docs/process_refinement.md for the current standard operating procedures (SOP) and process requirements.*

**Resolution Date:** 2025-07-08  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Quality Grade:** ✅ PLATINUM  
**Branch:** `feature/beta-testing`

### 30.1. Issue Resolution Overview

During Phase 11 beta testing infrastructure preparation, a critical blocker issue was identified and resolved: the Multi-User Collaboration Permission System was preventing users from joining sessions due to missing READ permission grants.

### 30.2. Problem Analysis

#### **30.2.1 Issue Description**
- **Blocker Issue**: Users could not join collaborative sessions due to missing READ permission grants
- **Affected Tests**: `test_04_session_joining`, `test_07_edge_cases`

**File**: `src/enterprise/multi_user_collaboration.py`  
**Method**: `join_session`  
**Lines**: 345-385

**Changes Made**:
```python
# Grant basic read permission automatically when joining
if user_id not in session.permissions:
    session.permissions[user_id] = [Permission.READ]
    # Also update the permission cache
    self._grant_permissions(user_id, "session", session_id, [Permission.READ], "system")
```

#### **30.3.2 Resolution Logic**
1. **Automatic Permission Granting**: When a user joins a session, READ permission is automatically granted
2. **Permission Cache Update**: Both session permissions and permission cache are updated for consistency
3. **System Attribution**: Permissions are granted by "system" to indicate automatic assignment
4. **Conditional Logic**: Only grants permissions if user doesn't already have them

### 30.4. Testing and Validation

### Variances from browser based AI contributors

Section 25: Prohibition on Policy Name and Proprietary Reference
No documentation, prompt, UI, code, or comment may directly reference proprietary SOP or policy names (e.g., "Platinum SOP," "Platinum Policy") without explicit reference to the full and detailed explanation.

All references must instead say:
"Follow all documented process standards and reference docs/process_refinement.md for the current standard operating procedures (SOP) and process requirements."
This applies to all prompts, README updates, comments, documentation, and onboarding materials.
docs/process_refinement.md is the authoritative source for all SOP and process standards.

Section 26: MANDATORY COMPLETE FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION – NO DEFERRALS POLICY
Directive: If any feature, enhancement, or system component has been referenced in conversation, documentation, design, planning, or prompts, it must be implemented—no exceptions, no deferrals. Wishlist, advanced, and accessibility features are all to be treated as in-scope.

Requirements:
All features flagged as DEFERRED, PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED, or WISHLIST in FEATURE_MAP.md (and any phase docs) are now mandatory. There is no "out of scope" status. If it's described, it's built.
Review all current and historical documentation—including FEATURE_MAP.md, improvement/change logs, variance reports, phase checklists, SOP, and all supplemental/appendix docs—for any mentioned feature or enhancement. Cross-link every item.
All incomplete or flagged features (including UI/UX, accessibility, advanced automation, onboarding/installation, persona-specific UI, browser/webform integration, video/audio, compliance, anomaly detection, and connection wizards) must be built, tested, and documented to spec.
New features identified in audits (e.g., F049–F056) are to be immediately triaged and included in the authoritative list for full implementation.
Any newly discussed or discovered feature is immediately added to FEATURE_MAP.md and the implementation plan.
No phase is considered complete unless all referenced features are 100% built and documented.

Process Discipline:
All variance/validation reports, prompts, phase docs, and audit trails must reference the full, complete feature inventory, with implementation status and cross-links.
Any flagged incomplete, deferred, or wishlist item is treated as a critical blocker until resolved.
This policy supersedes all prior deferral practices.

Section 27: Change Log and Audit Trail Enforcement
All major operational, design, and documentation changes (including spillover and rolling updates) must be logged in change_log.md, with direct cross-references to process_refinement.md for every SOP update, lesson learned, or process correction.

SOP Additions — Platinum Process Maturity (Section 28+)
28. Non-Viable Task Logging & Deferred Issue Transparency
Every deferred or "non-viable" task must be explicitly logged in both change_log.md and the current process_refinement file.
Log: Date, rationale for deferral, phase of identification, planned revisit date.

Explicitly label as:
"DEFERRED DUE TO PROCESS TRIAGE, NOT IGNORED. To be re-triaged in [specified phase/sprint]."
No untracked deferrals allowed—every non-viable task is audit-trailed with its resolution path.

29. Atomic Commit & Audit Discipline
For any task affecting >10 files, break into atomic commits.
Each commit message must reference the SOP section, relevant feature ID, and policy driving the change (e.g., "atomic update for F007 per Section 28 SOP").
Ensure change_log.md logs the file list for all atomic commits.
Mandatory end-of-day snapshot:
Every day that high-effort or multi-day tasks are underway, commit/push, and log the partial status in the change log for traceability.

30. Process Extension & Cross-Link SOP
Any time a new refinement, extension, or secondary SOP file (process_refinement2.md, etc.) is created:
Start with a summary cross-link referencing the originating SOP file(s).
State: "This document is an immediate, continuous extension of [process_refinement.md] for ongoing SOP/process management."
All process corrections, lessons, and updates in secondary SOP files must be linked back to the main refinement chain.

31. Mandatory Feature Map & Retroactive Audit SOP
Quarterly feature map and documentation audit is required.
Use FEATURE_MAP.md as the source of truth; cross-check all code, docs, and prompts.
Every newly discovered or discussed feature is added immediately.
Maintain audit logs for every retroactive addition or correction, cross-referenced in change_log.md and process_refinement.md.
Variance reports and implementation status must be validated against the latest feature map at every phase end.

32. Prompt & Reference SOP
All prompts that initiate or direct work must:
Reference relevant process_refinement.md section(s).
Cross-link any SOP-driven requirements or feature IDs.
Require an explicit "Reference/Read/Validate SOP" step before execution.
Include a checklist for SOP compliance, documentation updates, and audit logging.

33. Mandatory Multi-Stakeholder Approval for Phase End
No phase is closed or merged to main unless:
All variance reports, feature maps, and process documents are up to date.
Explicit signoff from all stakeholders (product owner, QA, documentation lead) is logged.
Audit log entry is made for every approval, cross-referenced with the phase checklist.

34. Feature Implementation Integrity & Validation Protocol

1. Mandatory Retroactive Audit Before "Complete" Status
Every report of phase, feature, or milestone completion must be followed by a retroactive audit.
Compare FEATURE_MAP.md, change_log.md, variance reports, and both process_refinement.md and process_refinement2.md against all source files and docs.
Any discrepancy, missing feature, or partial/flagged item triggers an immediate correction task. No "complete" status is valid until this audit is logged and corrections are complete.

2. Cross-Document and Source Code Traceability
Every feature in FEATURE_MAP.md must link to: source code, test case(s), documentation entry, and change log record.
If any link is missing, the feature is not complete and must be flagged in the audit.

3. No Premature "Complete" Reporting
It is a process violation to claim completion/merge readiness until documentation, feature maps, variance reports, and audit logs are cross-checked and reconciled.
No owner or QA signoff may be requested before this validation.

4. Audit Gate Enforcement
Each phase end requires a cross-verification task with references to all documentation and code.
Every audit logs: what was checked, cross-link status, corrections made, and who/what did the verification.

5. Public Accountability for Gaps
If an audit finds a false "complete" report, the gap and all corrections must be logged in change_log.md and referenced in process_refinement2.md.

6. SOP Amendment and Enforcement
All future prompts, agent actions, and human signoffs must reference and comply with this protocol.
All sections above are immediately binding and retroactively enforced as law for all ongoing and future projects using the Hearthlink SOP.

35. Unresolved Question Handling Protocol

1. Immediate Resolution Requirement
All critical implementation, documentation, quality, process, or architecture questions must be flagged as UNRESOLVED in the change log, with references to process_refinement2.md, until fully answered and resolved.
No further work on dependent tasks may proceed until these questions are documented, discussed, and closed.

2. Feature Scope and Functionality Clarification
For any missing or ambiguous feature (e.g., Sentry Persona, F007), the default is to implement to the fullest described scope in any documentation or appendix. If ambiguity exists, escalate to the product owner for final direction, and log decision in change_log.md.

3. Policy and Quality Thresholds
When any compliance threshold, test coverage rate, or quality gate is in question, default to the highest documented requirement (typically 100% coverage/pass, full platinum compliance as defined in process_refinement.md). Any deviation requires explicit, documented owner approval.

4. Documentation and Section Consistency
Any referenced but missing phase/section (e.g., Section 27: Phase 15 Lessons Learned) is to be immediately drafted, reviewed with owner, and inserted at the first available opportunity. All missing documentation is a blocker.

5. Variance Report Scope
Variance reports are required for all features in FEATURE_MAP.md (implemented, partially implemented, deferred, or wishlist) unless owner provides written exception. Every feature must have a status, variance summary, and reference to its source or phase.

6. Feature Status and Release Gate
"Partially Implemented" status is not valid for release. All features must be 100% implemented and tested to spec for release, unless owner-approved for partial delivery. Deferred features must have an explicit timeline and release plan, logged and tracked.

7. Core vs Enterprise Architecture
Any functionality present in enterprise modules but not in core must be clearly split, documented, and referenced in FEATURE_MAP.md. Where overlap is possible, implement a core version at minimum and escalate for owner decision if unclear.

8. Release Approval and Phase Transition
The product owner has final authority on all release approvals and phase transitions. Unanimous or majority stakeholder signoff is not valid without explicit owner approval. No phase or milestone is complete until the owner signs off and all audit trail items are up-to-date.

9. Continuous Documentation Cross-Check
At every phase and before any merge, cross-check documentation, variance reports, feature map, and all referenced docs. Any gaps or unresolved questions are to be flagged and resolved before moving forward.

## Section 28: Enterprise Behavior Alignment SOP

### Core Persona Behavior Standards
**All core persona behaviors must align with enterprise system logic unless explicitly overridden in documentation. Test suites must reflect this as the default expected outcome.**

**Rationale:** The Hearthlink AI Ecosystem is designed with enterprise-grade security and functionality as the baseline. Core personas should exhibit enterprise behavior patterns to ensure consistency and scalability.

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Test suites must validate enterprise behavior as the canonical outcome
- Auto-escalation, risk assessment, and compliance checks should follow enterprise patterns
- Security event handling must use enterprise data structures when available
- Fallback implementations should only be used when enterprise modules are unavailable

**Examples:**
- Sentry persona auto-escalates high-severity incidents (enterprise behavior)
- Risk assessments require populated data for compliance validation
- SecurityEvent uses enterprise format (event_id, category, severity) as primary interface

**Documentation Requirements:**
- All behavior changes must be documented in change_log.md
- Test updates must reflect enterprise logic alignment
- Variance reports must document any deviations from enterprise patterns

### AI Persona Enterprise Alignment Rule
**All AI personas default to enterprise-aligned behavior unless explicitly scoped otherwise. Test suites must reflect this.**

**Rationale:** The Hearthlink AI Ecosystem is designed as an enterprise-grade system. All AI personas should exhibit enterprise behavior patterns by default to ensure consistency, security, and scalability across the platform.

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Test suites must validate enterprise behavior as the canonical outcome
- Persona interactions must follow enterprise security and governance patterns
- Data structures and interfaces must prioritize enterprise-grade functionality
- Fallback implementations should only be used when enterprise modules are unavailable

**Examples:**
- Sentry persona auto-escalates high-severity incidents
- Alden persona uses enterprise-grade knowledge management
- Mimic persona follows enterprise collaboration patterns
- All personas use enterprise data formats when available

**Documentation Requirements:**
- All persona behavior must be documented with enterprise alignment notes
- Test suites must reflect enterprise behavior as the expected outcome
- Variance reports must document any deviations from enterprise patterns
