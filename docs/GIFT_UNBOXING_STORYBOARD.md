# Gift/Unboxing Experience Storyboard - Hearthlink Installer & Onboarding

## Overview

This storyboard transforms the Hearthlink installation and onboarding process into a delightful "gift/unboxing" experience that feels intentional, welcoming, and emotionally resonant. Following the Installation UX & First-Run Experience SOP, this experience sets the emotional and technical tone for the entire product journey.

## Design Philosophy: The Gift Metaphor

**Core Concept:** Installing Hearthlink should feel like unwrapping a carefully chosen gift—one that contains not just software, but seven AI companions ready to support, protect, and enhance the user's digital life.

**Emotional Journey:**
1. **Anticipation** - "Something special is about to happen"
2. **Discovery** - "Meet your new AI companions"
3. **Connection** - "These companions are here for you"
4. **Empowerment** - "You're now equipped for amazing possibilities"
