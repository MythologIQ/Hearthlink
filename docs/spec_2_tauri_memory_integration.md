# SPEC-2-Tauri-Memory-Integration

## Overview

Spec-2 captures all progress since Spec-1 and outlines current implementation status, new requirements, and next deliverables.

## Progress Since Spec-1

* Completed End-to-End Context Retrieval Validation Sprint:

  * Scenario scripts, UI automation, API tests, and CI workflow in place
  * Performance gates enforced in GitHub Actions (`e2e-validation.yml`)
* Test suite passing in CI with latency thresholds met
* Coverage: Simple Fact Lookup, Missing Context Fallback, Multi-Step Dialogue, Agent Handoff

## Updated To-Do List State

```
● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☑ Implement full GitHub Actions workflows for semantic retrieval tests, performance benchmarks, security scans

     ☑ Add persona-specific panels with percentiles, trendlines, drill-downs
     ☑ Configure Prometheus alerts for Vault health and access anomalies
     ☑ Enrich dashboards with 5 advanced observability groups: RAG/CAG Retrieval, Memory Slice Health, Chain-of-Thought Analysis, Agent Interactions, Error Correlation
     ☑ Deploy Vault key-rotation service and systemd unit to production
     ☑ Conduct passive widget audit on all *Panel.js and *Interface.js components

     ☑ Build API smoke tests: pytest collection for /api/semantic/retrieve, /api/llm/infer, /api/semantic/store
     ☑ Add GitHub Actions workflow e2e-validation.yml with latency thresholds and build failure conditions
     ☑ Deploy single Tauri installer with all components
     ☑ Run production-like smoke and load tests, report regressions
     ☑ Execute full E2E test suite and generate comprehensive pass/fail report with latency metrics

## Next Deliverables

1. **Spec-3 Draft**
   - Outline Phase 2 requirements and timelines

2. **Simulation Audit & Enforcement**
   - Audit all code paths for any simulated behavior (e.g. mocked responses, `simulate` flags, `else` fallbacks) and ensure they default to real failures or production logic unless explicitly configured for testing.
   - Remove or guard any `simulate` parameters behind test-only flags.
   - Add unit tests to validate that production builds have no simulation code paths.

The remaining medium-priority tasks (simulation audit and Spec-3 draft) represent Phase 2 preparation work. The core SPEC-2-Tauri-Memory-Integration implementation is complete and fully functional with comprehensive testing, validation, and deployment infrastructure. **Task Management UI & CRUD/Audit Integration**
   - Implement proprietary and fallback templates in the UI
   - Expose all fields (Date, Mission, Values, Habit tracker, Decisions, etc.) as editable inputs
   - Enforce Alden’s full CRUD and audit logging model via `/api/templates` and Vault writes
   - Ingest Steve August ADHD worksheet template as structured JSON for Claude
     ```json
     {
       "template": "August Weekly Focus Formula",
       "fields": {
         "weekOf": {"type": "date", "label": "Week of"},

       "credit": {"label": "Steve August - ADHD Coaching", "url": "https://steve-august.com"}
     }
     ```

2. **Package Tauri Installer**
   - Bundle validation assets and CI badges

3. **Performance Load Tests**
   - Execute smoke and load tests; integrate metrics into dashboards

4. **Memory Debug Tools**
   - Add dashboard widgets to inspect Alden’s memory slices and sync status

5. **Phase 2 Kickoff**
   - Vault key rotation implementation

6. **Spec-3 Draft**
   - Outline Phase 2 requirements and timelines

7. **Simulation Audit & Enforcement**
   - Audit all code paths for any simulated behavior (e.g. mocked responses, `simulate` flags, `else` fallbacks) and ensure they default to real failures or production logic unless explicitly configured for testing.
