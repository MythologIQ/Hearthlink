## Conclusion

This comprehensive audit has identified critical gaps in phase checklist and variance report cross-references that must be addressed before any merge can proceed. The primary issues are:

1. **Missing Sentry Persona Implementation** - Core feature F007 not implemented
2. **Incomplete Variance Reports** - Multiple features lack proper variance reporting
3. **Test Failure Resolution** - 2 blocker test issues remain unresolved
4. **Cross-Reference Gaps** - Some documentation cross-references need updating

**Recommendation:** Block all merges until critical blockers are resolved and platinum compliance is achieved.
