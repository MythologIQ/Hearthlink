## Lessons Learned

### 1. Import and Package Structure Issues

**Issue:** Core tests failing due to `SessionAnalysis` import errors and relative import problems.

**Root Cause:** 
- Missing `__init__.py` files in core modules
- Relative imports in Core module causing import failures
- Inconsistent package structure across modules

**Resolution:**
- Created `__init__.py` files for `src/`, `src/core/`, and `src/vault/`
- Fixed relative imports to use absolute imports
- Established proper Python package structure

**Lesson:** Package structure and import hygiene are critical for test reliability. All modules must have proper `__init__.py` files and consistent import patterns.

### 2. MCP Implementation Complexity

**Issue:** MCP was documented but not implemented in the codebase.

**Root Cause:** 
- MCP specification existed but no implementation was in place
- Resource policy enforcement was not integrated with existing security systems

**Resolution:**
- Implemented comprehensive MCP resource policy system
- Integrated with existing RBAC/ABAC and SIEM systems
- Established zero-trust resource access patterns

**Lesson:** Documentation without implementation creates technical debt. All documented protocols must have corresponding implementations.

### 3. Feature Prioritization Process

**Issue:** Feature wishlist was minimal without clear prioritization or implementation guidance.

**Root Cause:** 
- No systematic approach to feature evaluation
- Missing criteria for business value and technical complexity
- No implementation phase planning

**Resolution:**
- Established priority assessment matrix with scoring criteria
- Defined implementation phases based on priority scores
- Created comprehensive specification requirements

**Lesson:** Feature prioritization requires systematic evaluation criteria and clear implementation planning.

## Blockers Identified

### 1. Core Test Failures

**Blocker:** Core tests failing with `SessionAnalysis` import errors.

**Impact:** Cannot validate core functionality before proceeding to Phase 7.

**Resolution Required:**
- Fix import issues in Core module
- Resolve `SessionAnalysis` class definition
- Ensure all tests pass before Phase 7

**Priority:** High - Must resolve before Phase 7

### 2. Package Structure Inconsistencies

**Blocker:** Inconsistent package structure across modules.

**Impact:** Import failures and test reliability issues.

**Resolution Required:**
- Audit all module package structures
- Standardize import patterns
- Update all `__init__.py` files

**Priority:** Medium - Should resolve during Phase 7

### 3. Test Coverage Gaps

**Blocker:** Limited test coverage for new MCP resource policy system.

**Impact:** Cannot validate security controls and policy enforcement.

**Resolution Required:**
- Create comprehensive tests for MCP resource policy
- Test all security controls and audit logging
- Validate policy enforcement mechanisms

**Priority:** Medium - Should implement during Phase 7
