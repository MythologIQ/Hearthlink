1. **Create Missing Reports** (Priority: üî¥ CRITICAL)
   - Create variance reports for all missing features
   - Follow template format in PHASE_10_FEATURE_CHECKLIST.md
   - Include proper cross-references and implementation links
   - Archive completed reports in appropriate section

2. **Template Compliance** (Priority: üü° HIGH)
   - Ensure all variance reports follow established template
   - Include feature map integration requirements
   - Validate cross-references in all variance reports
   - Update archive section with new reports

### Timeline
- **Report Creation:** 24 hours

## üî¥ CRITICAL BLOCKER 3: Test Failure Resolution

### Issue Description
**Current Status:** 19/58 tests failing (67% pass rate)  
**Blocker Issues:** 2 remaining critical test failures  
**Impact:** Quality gates not satisfied, merge blocked

### Remaining Blocker Issues
1. **RBAC/ABAC Time-Based Policy Evaluation**
   - Test: `test_04_access_evaluation`
   - Issue: Time-based policy evaluation not working correctly
   - Root Cause: `_evaluate_time_hour` method returning incorrect results

2. **RBAC/ABAC Security Integration**
   - Test: `test_02_security_integration`
   - Issue: Security integration tests failing
   - Root Cause: Same time-based policy evaluation issue

### Business Impact
- **Quality Gates:** Test pass rate below acceptable threshold
- **Merge Blocking:** Cannot proceed with merge until resolved
- **System Reliability:** Security features not properly tested
- **User Confidence:** System stability compromised

### Required Actions
1. **Fix Time-Based Policy Evaluation** (Priority: üî¥ CRITICAL)
   - Review and fix `_evaluate_time_hour` method logic
   - Test time-based condition evaluation thoroughly
   - Validate all time-based access control scenarios
   - Update test cases to cover edge cases

2. **Resolve Security Integration** (Priority: üî¥ CRITICAL)
   - Fix security integration test failures
   - Validate RBAC/ABAC integration functionality
   - Update PHASE_8_TEST_TRIAGE.md with resolution status
   - Ensure all tests pass before merge

### Timeline
- **Code Fixes:** 24 hours
- **Testing and Validation:** 24 hours
- **Documentation Updates:** 12 hours
- **Total:** 2-3 days
