## 6. Technology Stack Decisions

### ADR-014: Voice Processing Technology Stack

**Status**: 📋 Planned  
**Date**: 2025-04-01  
**Category**: Technology  
**Deciders**: Voice Team, AI Team  

#### Context
We need to choose the technology stack for voice processing capabilities. Options include:
- Web Speech API only
- Python speech libraries (SpeechRecognition, pyttsx3)
- Hybrid approach with multiple engines
- Cloud speech services with local fallback
- Custom speech model training

#### Decision
Implement a hybrid approach using Web Speech API with Python speech library fallbacks.

#### Rationale
- **Browser Integration**: Web Speech API provides excellent browser integration
- **Offline Capability**: Python libraries work without internet connection
- **Accuracy**: Multiple engines can provide better overall accuracy
- **Language Support**: Different engines support different languages
- **Accessibility**: Multiple options ensure accessibility for diverse users

#### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Best-of-breed accuracy across different scenarios
- Offline functionality when cloud services unavailable
- Multiple language support options
- Fallback redundancy for reliability

**Negative:**
- Increased complexity in voice engine management
- Multiple dependencies and potential conflicts
- Higher resource usage with multiple engines
- More complex testing and validation

#### Implementation Plan
```typescript
interface VoiceEngine {
  startListening(): Promise<void>;
  stopListening(): Promise<void>;
  onResult: (transcript: string) => void;
  onError: (error: Error) => void;
}

class VoiceProcessor {
  private engines: VoiceEngine[] = [
    new WebSpeechEngine(),
    new PythonSpeechEngine(),
    new WhisperEngine()
  ];
  
  async processVoice(audioData: ArrayBuffer): Promise<string> {
    for (const engine of this.engines) {
      try {
        return await engine.transcribe(audioData);
      } catch (error) {
        console.warn(`Engine ${engine.name} failed:`, error);
      }
    }
    throw new Error('All voice engines failed');
  }
}
```

#### Context
We needed to choose a state management solution for the React frontend. Options included:
- React Context + useReducer
- Redux Toolkit
- Zustand
- Valtio
- Custom state management

#### Decision
Use React Context + useReducer for global state with custom hooks for feature-specific state.

#### Rationale
- **Simplicity**: No additional dependencies for basic state management
- **TypeScript Integration**: Excellent TypeScript support with React
- **Bundle Size**: No additional libraries to bundle
- **Learning Curve**: Team familiar with React patterns
- **Flexibility**: Easy to migrate to external library if needed

#### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Simple and straightforward state management
- No additional dependencies or bundle size
- Excellent TypeScript integration
- Easy testing with React Testing Library

**Negative:**
- Potential performance issues with large state objects
- More boilerplate compared to specialized libraries
- Manual optimization required for preventing re-renders
- Limited development tools compared to Redux

#### Implementation Pattern
```typescript
// Global app context
interface AppState {
  user: UserState;
  agents: AgentState;
  ui: UIState;
}

type AppAction = 
  | { type: 'SET_USER'; payload: UserState }
  | { type: 'UPDATE_AGENT'; payload: { id: string; data: Partial<Agent> } }
  | { type: 'TOGGLE_RADIAL_MENU' };

const AppContext = createContext<{
  state: AppState;
  dispatch: Dispatch<AppAction>;
} | null>(null);

// Custom hooks for feature-specific state
const useAgentState = (agentId: string) => {
  const context = useContext(AppContext);
  const agent = context.state.agents[agentId];
  
  const updateAgent = useCallback((data: Partial<Agent>) => {
    context.dispatch({ type: 'UPDATE_AGENT', payload: { id: agentId, data } });
  }, [agentId, context.dispatch]);
  
  return { agent, updateAgent };
};
```
