# Phase 10: Mandatory Feature Map Integration & Process Enhancement

## üìã Executive Summary

Phase 10 addresses a major oversight in the development process where features weren't being systematically tracked across phases, leading to gaps in documentation and implementation tracking. This phase revises all prompt templates and phase planning documents to require explicit reference to `/docs/FEATURE_MAP.md`, status of all tracked features for the phase, and cross-reference confirmation in variance and validation reports.

**Duration:** July 7, 2025 - July 14, 2025  
**Status:** üîÑ In Progress  
**Success Criteria:** All prompt templates and phase planning docs updated with mandatory feature map integration  
**Dependencies:** Phase 9 completion and comprehensive feature map validation
