## [Sprint 2025-07-10] UI Screen Alignment Compliance
- **Resolved TEST_PLAN.md Reference Issue**: Owner determined that `/tests/TEST_PLAN.md` is no longer required as a standalone document
- **Implemented Distributed Test Policy Structure**: Test requirements now distributed across:
  - `/docs/process_refinement.md` - Test planning requirements and UI test implementation standards
  - `/docs/VOICE_ACCESS_POLICY.md` - Voice functionality test requirements
  - `/docs/UI_ALIGNMENT_AUDIT.md` - UI screen validation requirements
  - `/docs/TEST_REFERENCE.md` - Test reference and traceability
- **Updated Process Refinement**: Added Section 11 "UI Test Policy & Compliance" with:
  - Distributed test policy structure documentation
  - UI test implementation standards (branch naming, commit format, traceability)
  - Voice test compliance requirements
  - UI screen validation requirements
  - Test execution and review flow
- **Updated Sprint Completion Log**: Added "Resolved Uncertainties" section documenting TEST_PLAN.md resolution
- **Updated Test Reference Documentation**: Modified `/tests/TEST_REFERENCE.md` to reflect distributed approach
- **Removed References**: Eliminated all references to `/tests/TEST_PLAN.md` from documentation and prompts
- **Implementation Status**: All UI test work can now proceed under current traceable test policy structure

## [Sprint 2025-07-10] Voice Routing Compliance Implementation

- **Enhanced App.js** with voice routing state management and agent change handling
- **Updated CSS** with comprehensive styling for routing controls, agent confirmation, and enhanced command history
- **Created comprehensive test suite** (`tests/test_voice_routing_compliance.py`) covering all voice policy requirements
- **Test coverage includes:** voice access states, local/external agent permissions, routing logic, authentication, offline mode, fallback states, logging transparency, agent identity confirmation, and Vault logging
- **Voice routing features:** agent name detection, delegation protocol, external agent blocking, session logging, audit trail, and edge case handling
- **All agent interaction screens** now display agent identity and routing confirmation per policy requirements

## [Sprint 2025-07-10] UI Test Coverage Implementation
- Created comprehensive UI test suite (`tests/test_ui_comprehensive.py`) covering all 29 UI screens from audit report
- Implemented voice interaction test suite (`tests/test_voice_interaction.py`) for VOICE_ACCESS_POLICY.md compliance
- Added test cases for major UI elements, edge cases, and voice interaction scenarios across all modules
- Updated `/tests/README.md` with complete test coverage documentation and execution commands
- Test coverage includes: Alden (6 screens), Alice (2 screens), Core (6 screens), Synapse (2 screens), Sentry (2 screens), Vault (3 screens), Settings (3 screens), Help/Docs (1 screen), Universal (2 screens)
- Voice interaction tests cover: access states, local/external agent permissions, routing logic, authentication, offline mode, fallback states, logging, and policy compliance
- All tests include edge cases, accessibility compliance, and error handling scenarios
- Test results saved to `tests/ui_test_results.json` and `tests/voice_interaction_test_results.json`

## [Sprint YYYY-MM-DD]
- Renamed "ADHD Dashboard" to **Productivity Center** for clarity; all references updated.
- Initiated restoration of the radial module launcher (MythologIQ branding, module icons, unified entry point).
- Began unification of UI theme, color palette, and navigation across all modules (per SOP and design standards).
- Ensured all modules (Productivity Center, Core/Nexus, etc.) are accessible from the launcher.
- Updated terminology: "Dashboards" now refer to report/metric views only.
- Referenced SOP and design standards in all UI/UX changes. 

## [Sprint YYYY-MM-DD] (continued)
- Clarified and finalized UI/UX plan: Starcraft-inspired, radial main menu with 7 modules, each with its own interface and navigation (per build docs).
- Confirmed Alden, Core, Vault, and Synapse as key functional modules for Sprint 1 delivery; Vault UI intentionally simple.
- Updated Selenium UI/integration tests and mockups to reflect hierarchical, modular navigation and sci-fi theme.
- Proceeding with implementation and documentation for full Sprint 1 completion. 

## [Sprint YYYY-MM-DD] (continued)
- Began Sprint 1 with a testing-led approach: creating Selenium-based UI/integration tests for the radial launcher and Productivity Center.
- Added plan to generate multimodal UI mockups (diagrams/wireframes) for each module as development progresses.
- All changes and test-driven iterations will be logged here for traceability. 

## [Sprint YYYY-MM-DD] (continued)
- Created Selenium-based UI/integration test suite for the radial launcher and Productivity Center (test_ui_launcher_and_productivity_center.py).
- Generated and shared the first multimodal UI mockup (radial launcher module flow diagram).
- All Sprint 1 deliverables now have corresponding tests and visual documentation. 

## [Sprint YYYY-MM-DD] (final)
- Alice module and Cognitive Behavioral Profiling system are now first-class features, fully implemented and accessible from the main menu.
- All 7 modules (Alden, Alice, Core, Vault, Synapse, Sentry, Mimic) are present and accessible from the main radial menu.
- All corrections and clarifications (including removal of 'Nexus' and explicit inclusion of Alice) have been implemented and tested.
- Variance report and SOP compliance confirmed for Sprint 1 completion.
