## 1. System Overview

Hearthlink is a privacy-first, modular, and local-first AI ecosystem for personal knowledge work and agent orchestration. All modules (Alden, Alice, Mimic, Sentry, Vault, Core, Synapse) are strictly containerized and enforce user sovereignty, auditable actions, and explicit separation of local and shared/communal memory.

---

## 2. Architectural Requirements

### 2.1 Modularity & Boundaries

- Each module (Alden, Alice, Mimic, Sentry, Core, Vault, Synapse) runs as a discrete service or process, communicating via IPC/WebSocket API.
- **Core never mediates or accesses local persona memory or local Vault databases.**
- **Local agent memory is always direct agent-to-Vault. Core is only used for memory operations when explicitly working with Core Communal Memory.**
- All cross-agent, collaborative, plugin, or external flows (session logs, roundtables, plugin ops, etc.) are mediated by Core, logged by Sentry, and stored in Vault’s shared/communal area when user-approved.
- Sentry hooks every event, and Synapse governs all external/plugin flows.

### 2.2 Data Security

- AES-256 (or higher) encryption at rest.
- Each agent/persona maintains an isolated, encrypted memory schema.
- No cloud, SaaS, or background telemetry by default.
- User is always able to view, export, and delete all data.
- OS keyring, hardware TPM, or secure enclave for key management.

### 2.3 Process, Resource, and Plugin Management

- All agent, plugin, and extension processes sandboxed; least privilege.
- Logging/caching is tunable per module; capped by user/system preference.
- Plugins/extensions are only installed and executed through Synapse, with permission manifest, sandbox, risk/benchmark scores, and Sentry monitoring.

### 2.4 UI/UX & Accessibility

- All UIs are built with Next.js/React, modular, and fully accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA minimum).
- All user-facing flows match MythologIQ’s mythic-tech theme.
- Persona dashboards, utility strips, status bars, and logs are fully keyboard and screen reader accessible.
- All persona UIs reflect their core purpose and data contract.

## 3. Module Technical Requirements

### 3.1 Alden (Evolutionary Companion)

- **UI:** Dashboard/hub, cognition engine, relationship log, and self-reflection overlays.
- **Logic:** Growth, streaks, and learning logs to Alden’s Vault slice; no other persona can access this data.
- **API:** CRUD for tasks, habits, feedback, and milestone journaling; export/import with full changelog.
- **Interaction:** “Reflect,” “Teach,” and “Coach” events update Alden’s learning model, with all interactions logged.

### 3.2 Alice (Behavioral Analytics)

- **UI:** Dashboard for tone/cadence trends, empathy overlays, understanding scroll.
- **Logic:** Adapts to user’s meta-communication; never accesses task, goal, or direct memory.
- **API:** Log, query, feedback injection, correction endpoints.
- **Security:** All corrections/audits logged; evolution tracked per user session, always user-reviewable.

### 3.3 Mimic (Persona Generator)

- **UI:** Persona carousel, analytics dashboard, creation/curation wizard.
- **Logic:** Each persona has its own encrypted memory slice, indexed by user-supplied traits.
- **API:** CRUD for persona data, performance analytics, archive/restore, export/import.

### 3.4 Sentry (Guardian/Security)

- **Process:** Root/elevated if required, only user/admin can stop Sentry.
- **Logic:** Monitors and can kill/block/rollback any agent, process, or plugin.
- **UI:** Technical log view and user-friendly compliance dashboard.
- **API:** Subscribe/log event, policy update, override, incident review/export.

### 3.5 Vault (Secure Memory Store)

- **Backend:** JSON, SQLite, or local DB, segregated per persona.
- **Security:** All access by API only, export/purge/backup user-controlled.
- **API:** CRUD, query, audit log, user export/import.

### 3.6 Core (Orchestrator/Communal Context)

- **Process:** Local WebSocket/IPC process manager for sessions and cross-agent events.
- **Logic:** Only manages shared/communal memory and agent-to-agent or external flows.
- **API:** Session control, agent suggestion, session log, room management, export.

### 3.7 Synapse (Plugin/API Gateway)

- **Security:** Only entry point for all plugin, API, browser automation, and external code.
- **UI:** Live traffic summary, drill-down per connection.
- **API:** Register plugin, approve/deny, fetch traffic summary/log, export audit.

---

## 4. Technical UI Requirements

- **Frontend:** All components in Next.js/React, full modularity, accessibility, and MythologIQ theming.
- **UX:** All logs, controls, and critical system messages are surfaced live.
- **Electron:** Desktop parity; all features local/offline.

---

## 5. Integration Requirements

- All cross-agent, plugin, or external traffic is mediated by Core and Synapse and logged by Sentry.
- **All local agent/persona memory is accessed directly via Vault APIs, never via Core, except for Core Communal Memory operations.**
- No module can bypass Sentry logging or Vault API access for persistence.
- Each agent/plugin must authenticate and register with Sentry and (if needed) Core.
- All session and memory export/imports are versioned and auditable.

---

## 6. Testing & Compliance

- **Security:** Fuzz/penetration tested per boundary; agent isolation, privilege escalation, override paths tested per release.
- **Privacy:** User audit, memory visibility, and export controls validated under edge and high-load.
- **Performance:** Log/cache controls must not breach user-specified budgets.
- **Accessibility:** Full screen reader/keyboard/contrast validation.

---

## 7. Installation, Update & Recovery

- Installer: user-selectable modules; all dependencies included or sourced locally.
- No forced updates; offline update and rollback supported.
- Schema migrations must include dry-run and rollback path.

---

## 8. Data Schema Reference

- **Persona Slice:**\
  `{ persona_id, session_id, timestamp, topic, data_type, payload (encrypted), usage_stats, provenance, user_tags, schema_version }`
- **Session Log:**\
  `{ session_id, agent_list, start_time, end_time, event_log, outcome, user_feedback, escalation_flags }`
- **Plugin/Event Log:**\
  `{ plugin_id, event_type, timestamp, origin, destination, outcome, risk_level, user_approval }`

---

## 9. Milestones

1. Core Framework, Vault, and Sentry (secure orchestration and storage)
2. Alden, Alice, Mimic UI/logic (modular, fully independent)
3. Synapse/plugin API and extension protocol
4. Full audit/test matrix
5. Accessibility/compliance
6. Packaging and deployment

---

## 10. Technical Risk Management (Summarized)

- **Memory Schema:** Per-persona schema, unified core schema for local agents, robust MCP for ongoing migration, forward/back compat.
- **Plugin Security:** Synapse defines risk/benchmark; Sentry enforces, user tunes performance tiers, automated kill switches.
- **Anomaly Handling:** Favor false positive, anomaly review dashboard, Sentry “learns” user risk tolerance, health checks.
- **Vault/Local-First:** Multi-system only via isolated DB and strict schema negotiation/handshake, dry-run preview, versioned contract.
- **Philosophy:** All multi-system friction intentional for security; every plugin/extension is a potential attack vector, regular code review/manifest signing/versioned scoring required.
