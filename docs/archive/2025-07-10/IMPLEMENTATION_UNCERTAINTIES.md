# Implementation Uncertainties - Owner Review Required

## Overview
This document flags implementation uncertainties identified during the voice routing compliance implementation that require owner review before proceeding. Per process_refinement.md SOP, these judgment calls must be documented and flagged for owner review.

## üö® CRITICAL UNCERTAINTIES - IMMEDIATE REVIEW REQUIRED

### 1. Voice Authentication Implementation Scope
**Issue**: VOICE_ACCESS_POLICY.md specifies "Secure Mode Activation" with activation phrase ‚Üí challenge phrase ‚Üí PIN entry ‚Üí Dev Mode UI, but the current test implementation uses mock methods.

**Uncertainty**: 
- Should voice authentication be fully implemented in the UI components or remain mocked for testing?
- What is the specific activation phrase format required?
- Should PIN entry be voice-based or UI-based?
- How should Dev Mode UI be secured and what features should it include?

**Policy Reference**: `/docs/VOICE_ACCESS_POLICY.md` - "Voice Authentication & Dev Mode Activation"
**Impact**: Affects test validity and UI implementation scope
**Owner Decision Required**: Yes - before proceeding with voice authentication features

### 2. Vault Logging Integration Level
**Issue**: The policy requires "All voice sessions (transcripts + command triggers) are stored in Vault unless private mode is active" but current implementation uses mock Vault API calls.

**Uncertainty**:
- Should Vault logging be integrated with actual Vault module or remain mocked?
- What is the exact data structure required for Vault storage?
- How should private mode be implemented and detected?
- Should Vault logging be real-time or batched?

**Policy Reference**: `/docs/VOICE_ACCESS_POLICY.md` - "Logging & Transparency"
**Impact**: Affects data persistence and audit trail completeness
**Owner Decision Required**: Yes - before proceeding with Vault integration

### 3. External Agent Permission Implementation
**Issue**: Policy specifies external agents require "Explicit user activation" via "Core ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí External Agents ‚Üí Voice Interaction" but this UI path doesn't exist in current implementation.

**Uncertainty**:
- Should the Core Settings UI be implemented for external agent permissions?
- What specific permission controls are required?
- How should permission state be persisted and validated?
- Should there be a permission approval workflow?

**Policy Reference**: `/docs/VOICE_ACCESS_POLICY.md` - "External Agent Voice Permissions"
**Impact**: Affects security model and UI implementation scope
**Owner Decision Required**: Yes - before proceeding with external agent features

### 4. Offline Mode Detection and Behavior
**Issue**: Policy specifies offline mode behavior but doesn't define how offline state should be detected or what constitutes "local LLM" functionality.

**Uncertainty**:
- How should offline mode be detected (network connectivity, API availability)?
- What constitutes "local LLM" for offline functionality?
- Should offline mode be automatic or user-selectable?
- How should the "External services unavailable" alert be implemented?

**Policy Reference**: `/docs/VOICE_ACCESS_POLICY.md` - "Offline Mode / No Internet"
**Impact**: Affects system reliability and user experience
**Owner Decision Required**: Yes - before proceeding with offline mode features

## ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM PRIORITY UNCERTAINTIES

### 5. Voice HUD Implementation Scope
**Issue**: Policy mentions "Universal voice HUD" but doesn't specify implementation details.

**Uncertainty**:
- Should voice HUD be a separate UI component or integrated into existing interfaces?
- What visual/audio feedback should be provided?
- How should agent selection via voice HUD work?
- Should voice HUD be always visible or toggleable?

**Policy Reference**: `/docs/VOICE_ACCESS_POLICY.md` - "Voice Access States"
**Impact**: Affects UI design and user experience
**Owner Decision Required**: Yes - before finalizing voice HUD implementation

### 6. Agent Deference Protocol Implementation
**Issue**: Policy specifies "If addressed, a local agent responds‚Äîeven if suboptimal for task" but doesn't define the specific response format or when deference should occur.

**Uncertainty**:
- What triggers agent deference (task complexity, agent capability)?
- Should deference be automatic or user-configurable?
- What is the specific response format for deference messages?
- How should suboptimal task handling be implemented?

**Policy Reference**: `/docs/VOICE_ACCESS_POLICY.md` - "Fallback & Error States"
**Impact**: Affects agent interaction logic and user experience
**Owner Decision Required**: Yes - before implementing deference protocol

### 7. Voice Misrouting Prevention UI
**Issue**: Policy specifies "If a user intends to speak with a local agent and an external agent is enabled, the system prompts" but doesn't define the UI for this prompt.

**Uncertainty**:
- Should misrouting prevention be a voice prompt, UI dialog, or both?
- How should user intent be determined?
- What should happen if user cancels the external agent engagement?
- Should this be configurable by user?

**Policy Reference**: `/docs/VOICE_ACCESS_POLICY.md` - "Fallback & Error States"
**Impact**: Affects security and user experience
**Owner Decision Required**: Yes - before implementing misrouting prevention

## üìã IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS REQUIRED

### Current Status
- ‚úÖ **Test Framework**: Fully implemented and compliant
- ‚úÖ **Basic Voice Routing**: Agent detection and routing logic implemented
- ‚úÖ **Test Infrastructure**: Environment setup, logging, and reporting implemented
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **UI Integration**: Requires owner decisions on scope and implementation details
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Features**: Requires owner decisions on authentication and permissions
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Data Persistence**: Requires owner decisions on Vault integration

### Recommended Next Steps
1. **Owner Review**: Review all uncertainties and provide implementation guidance
2. **Scope Definition**: Define which features should be fully implemented vs. mocked
3. **UI Design**: Specify UI requirements for settings, authentication, and alerts
4. **Integration Planning**: Define integration points with Vault, Core, and other modules
5. **Security Review**: Validate security model and permission implementation

## üîó TRACEABILITY

### Documents Referenced
- `/docs/VOICE_ACCESS_POLICY.md` - Primary policy document
- `/docs/process_refinement.md` - SOP for implementation uncertainty handling
- `/docs/change_log.md` - Implementation history
- `/tests/TEST_PLAN.md` - Test requirements and scope

### Feature IDs Affected
- **VOICE-001**: Voice routing compliance (main feature)
- **UI-001**: Agent interaction screens (affected by UI decisions)
