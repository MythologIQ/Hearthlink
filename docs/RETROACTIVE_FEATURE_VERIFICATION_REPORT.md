## Immediate Feature Tracking Process

### New SOP Established

**Section 23: Immediate Feature Tracking SOP** added to `process_refinement.md`

### Key Requirements

1. **24-Hour Capture** - Any feature mention must be added to `/docs/FEATURE_MAP.md` within 24 hours
2. **Unique Identifier Assignment** - All features receive immediate F### identifier
3. **Complete Documentation** - Full feature information including type, status, and cross-references
4. **Cross-Reference Updates** - All documentation updated to maintain consistency
5. **Quality Gates** - Feature map compliance as mandatory pre-merge requirement

### Enforcement Mechanisms

- **Pre-Merge Requirement**: No merge allowed without feature map validation
- **Phase Closure Requirement**: No phase closure without feature map review
- **Documentation Compliance**: 100% feature coverage required
