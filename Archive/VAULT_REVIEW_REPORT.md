           fcntl.flock(f.fileno(), fcntl.LOCK_EX)
           try:
               # Atomic write operation
               f.write(encrypted_data)
               f.flush()
               os.fsync(f.fileno())
           finally:
               fcntl.flock(f.fileno(), fcntl.LOCK_UN)
   ```

2. **Schema Validation**
   ```python
   def _validate_schema(self, data, expected_type):
       required_fields = self._get_required_fields(expected_type)
       return all(field in data for field in required_fields)
   ```

3. **Data Integrity Checks**
   ```python
   def _calculate_checksum(self, data):
       return hashlib.sha256(json.dumps(data, sort_keys=True).encode()).hexdigest()
   ```

4. **Backup and Recovery**
   ```python
   def create_backup(self, backup_path):
       # Create backup before major operations
       pass
