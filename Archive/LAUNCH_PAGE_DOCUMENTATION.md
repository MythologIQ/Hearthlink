## Animation Sequence

### **Phase 1: Initialization (0-2 seconds)**
1. Starfield background begins animation
2. MythologIQ title appears with golden glow
3. Central loading icon starts rotating
4. Electric blue backlighting begins pulsing

### **Phase 2: Icon Emergence (2-4 seconds)**
1. Floating persona icons appear one by one
2. Each icon has a staggered entrance animation
3. Golden glows activate around each icon
4. Icons begin subtle floating motion

### **Phase 3: Loading Progress (4-12 seconds)**
1. Progress bar fills with realistic loading steps
2. Status messages update with system initialization
3. Pulse rings activate around central icon
4. All animations reach full intensity

### **Phase 4: Completion (12-14 seconds)**
1. Progress reaches 100%
2. Welcome message appears
3. Fade transition prepares for main app
4. All animations maintain until transition

## Technical Implementation

### **CSS Animations**
- **Keyframe Animations**: Smooth, performance-optimized animations
