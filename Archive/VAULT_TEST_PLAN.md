# Vault Test Plan

Comprehensive test plan for the Vault secure memory system, covering all platinum QA and data flow requirements.

## Overview

This plan ensures the Vault module meets requirements for secure, auditable, and isolated memory for all personas and communal data, as specified in the platinum checklists and end-to-end data flow documentation.

## Test Categories

### 1. CRUD Operations
- Create, read, update, and delete persona memory
- Create, read, update, and delete communal memory
- Validate data integrity after each operation

### 2. Memory Isolation
- Ensure persona memory is only accessible by the correct user
- Confirm no cross-persona or cross-user access is possible
- Attempt unauthorized access and verify denial

### 3. Export/Import
- Export persona and communal memory as JSON
- Import valid and invalid data, check schema enforcement
- Validate round-trip (export, purge, import, read)

### 4. Purge
- Purge persona and communal memory
- Confirm data is securely deleted and not accessible after purge
- Audit log records all purge actions

### 5. Error Handling
- Simulate and log errors for all operations (e.g., invalid data, permission denied, corrupted storage)
- Ensure all exceptions are logged with details and tracebacks
- Confirm system stability after errors

### 6. Audit Logging
- Every operation (CRUD, export, import, purge, error) is logged
- Audit log is append-only and exportable
- Log entries include timestamp, user, persona, action, and result

### 7. End-to-End Data Flow
- Reference /docs/appendix_f_end_to_end_data_flow_examples.md for scenario-based tests
- Simulate real user flows: create, update, export, purge, import, and audit review

### 8. QA Checklist Compliance
- Reference /docs/appendix_h_developer_qa_platinum_checklists.md
- Confirm all platinum QA requirements for Vault are met

## Test Execution

- Run `python test_vault.py` to execute all automated tests
- Review output for pass/fail and audit log details
- Manually inspect audit log and exported data for completeness

## Success Criteria

- All tests pass with no unhandled exceptions
- No unauthorized access or data leakage between personas
- All actions and errors are logged and exportable
- System remains stable and recoverable after simulated errors
