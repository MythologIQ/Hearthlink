- **Security Features**:
  - Per-agent session isolation with 30-minute timeout
  - URL whitelisting with domain and pattern validation
  - Content sanitization removing dangerous tags and attributes
  - CSP enforcement with configurable JavaScript enablement
  - Live preview module with security controls
  - Comprehensive audit logging and security violation tracking

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Implementation Uncertainties Requiring Owner Review

### 3. SYN004 Webhook Configuration Security Model
- **Issue**: Need clarification on webhook credential storage and validation
- **Questions**:
  - Should webhook credentials be stored encrypted in Vault or Synapse?
  - What validation should be performed on webhook endpoints?
  - How should rate limiting be implemented for webhook calls?
- **Impact**: Security and performance implications
- **Owner Decision Required**: Credential management and validation approach

### 4. SYN005 Credential Manager Integration
- **Issue**: Need clarification on credential manager integration with existing Vault
- **Questions**:
  - Should SYN005 be a separate module or integrated with Vault?
  - How should credential injection work with browser preview (SYN003)?
  - What audit logging format should be used for credential operations?
- **Impact**: Architecture and security implications
- **Owner Decision Required**: Module integration strategy

### 5. DOC001 API Documentation Scope
- **Issue**: Need clarification on API documentation scope and format
- **Questions**:
  - Should API documentation include interactive examples?
  - What format should be used (OpenAPI/Swagger, custom format)?
  - Should documentation be auto-generated from code or manually maintained?
- **Impact**: Documentation maintenance and user experience
- **Owner Decision Required**: Documentation approach and scope

### 6. Voice Access Policy Enforcement
- **Issue**: Need clarification on voice access policy enforcement mechanism
- **Questions**:
  - How should voice routing exclusions be technically implemented?
  - What should happen if voice commands are attempted on excluded modules?
  - How should user feedback be provided for voice access restrictions?
- **Impact**: User experience and security enforcement
- **Owner Decision Required**: Technical implementation approach

## üîç Cross-Reference Validation Results

### ‚úÖ Validated References
- All SYN003, SYN004, SYN005 features properly referenced in FEATURE_MAP.md
- DOC001 properly mapped to Help panel in UI_ALIGNMENT_AUDIT.md
- Voice access restrictions properly documented in VOICE_ACCESS_POLICY.md
- Synapse guidelines properly included in process_refinement.md
- Security requirements properly integrated across all modules

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Gaps Identified
- No specific test plans for SYN004, SYN005 features
- No detailed security audit requirements for Synapse modules
- No performance benchmarks defined for webhook functionality
- No user acceptance criteria defined for credential manager

## üìã Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Owner Review**: Remaining implementation uncertainties require Owner review
2. **Decision Documentation**: Owner decisions must be documented in this file
3. **Implementation Planning**: Once decisions are made, create detailed implementation plans
4. **Test Planning**: Create comprehensive test plans for remaining features

### Post-Decision Actions
1. **Implementation**: Begin implementation only after all uncertainties resolved
2. **Testing**: Execute comprehensive test suites for all features
3. **Documentation**: Update all documentation with implementation details
4. **Review**: Conduct final documentation alignment verification
