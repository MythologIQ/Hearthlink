# Hearthlink - Advanced Multi-Agent Collaborative Development System

## Project Overview
Hearthlink is a revolutionary Electron desktop application that enables multiple AI agents (LLMs) to collaborate in real-time through structured conference-style interfaces. This represents a paradigm shift from single-LLM development tools to true collaborative AI development ecosystems.

## Complete System Architecture

### âœ… Fully Implemented (Current State)
- **Electron + React Foundation** - Complete desktop app with 1400x900 resolution
- **Voice System** - Full Web Speech API integration with agent routing
- **Accessibility Framework** - ARIA compliance, keyboard navigation, high contrast
- **Task Management** - CRUD operations with priority and voice commands
- **Security Framework** - Context isolation, secure file serving, IPC communication
- **UI Components** - 30 screens mapped across 7 core modules

### ðŸŽ¯ Core Innovation: Multi-Agent Conference System
Unlike traditional single-LLM tools (Cursor, ChatGPT), Hearthlink creates **collaborative AI conferences** where multiple agents work together through:
- **Text-based conference UI** - Multiple LLMs discussing problems in real-time
- **Breakout rooms** - Topic-specific agent collaborations  
- **Context sharing** - Shared memory and decision history across agents
- **Agent orchestration** - Smart participant selection and moderation

### 7-Module System Architecture

#### 1. **Alden** - Primary Productivity Agent
- Executive function support, ADHD assistance, adaptive learning
- **Screens**: Radial Menu, Weekly Dashboard, Self-Care Tracker, Goal Setting, Decision Friction, Productivity Center
- **Current**: Hardcoded responses (needs real AI integration)

#### 2. **Alice** - Behavioral Analysis & Context Awareness  
- Communication pattern analysis, empathy validation, conversation coaching
- **Screens**: Main Interface, Session Review
- **Focus**: Meta-communication trends, user behavior patterns

#### 3. **Core** - Communication Switch & Multi-Agent Orchestrator
- **Primary Innovation Hub** - Manages all multi-agent collaborations
- **Screens**: Command Center, Agent Orchestration, Session Management, Logs, Secure Rooms, Dev Mode, Notifications
- **Key Features**: Breakout rooms, agent suggestion, context mediation, external agent integration

#### 4. **Synapse** - External Gateway & Plugin Manager
- Secure boundary for all external connections, plugin management, manifest enforcement
- **Screens**: Plugin Dashboard, Install/Config Modal  
- **Security**: Sandboxing, benchmarking, risk scoring

#### 5. **Sentry** - Security & Compliance Oversight
- Real-time threat detection, audit trails, user-controllable interventions
- **Screens**: Security Dashboard, Kill Switch Panel
- **Features**: Anomaly detection, override capabilities, compliance reporting

#### 6. **Vault** - Persona-Aware Secure Memory
- Encrypted, segregated memory per agent with strict access controls
- **Screens**: Main Dashboard, Memory Permissions, Diagnostics
- **Security**: Zero-trust cross-persona access, full audit trails

#### 7. **Universal Components**
- Voice HUD, Agent Chat Interfaces, Settings, Help, Room Manager
- **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation, screen reader support

### Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: Electron + React 18.2.0, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Python (needs integration via IPC)
- **Voice**: Web Speech API with command routing
- **Security**: AES-256 encryption, context isolation
- **Build**: Electron Builder with MSI packaging
- **Storage**: Local-first, encrypted, no cloud by default

### Development Priorities for Claude Code

#### Phase 1: Backend Integration (Critical)
- Connect Python backend to Electron IPC system
- Implement real AI integration (replace hardcoded Alden responses)
- Add data persistence layer for tasks, goals, conversations

#### Phase 2: Multi-Agent Conference System (Core Innovation)
- Build collaborative text-based conference UI in Core module
- Implement agent orchestration and suggestion system
- Create breakout room functionality
- Develop context sharing between agents

#### Phase 3: VS Code Integration (Collaborative Coding)
- Embed open-source VS Code component
- Enable real-time collaborative editing
- Integrate with agent conference system for code review/discussion

#### Phase 4: External Agent Framework (Community)
- Complete Synapse plugin/agent connector system
- Implement community LLM integration framework
- Add external agent benchmarking and security

### Existing Assets
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: 30+ technical specs, implementation guides, UI blueprints
- **Complete UI Designs**: Thematic designs for Alden and Core modules (ready for upload)
- **Robust Testing Framework**: Test suites for core functionality
- **Security Implementation**: Full compliance and security framework

### Competitive Advantage
This system transforms LLM development tools from single-agent assistants to **collaborative AI ecosystems**, enabling:
- Multiple AI perspectives on complex problems
- Specialized agent expertise (research, security, analysis)
- Real-time collaborative code development
- Community-driven agent marketplace
- Enterprise-grade security and compliance

### Claude Code Integration Strategy
Focus on Core module development and backend integration as these unlock the collaborative multi-agent functionality that represents Hearthlink's revolutionary approach to AI-assisted development.

## Current Status
- **Frontend**: 95% complete, all UI components functional
- **Backend**: Exists but not integrated (priority #1)
- **AI Integration**: Hardcoded responses (priority #2)  
- **Multi-Agent System**: Framework ready, needs implementation (core innovation)
- **Documentation**: Complete and implementation-ready
- **UI Designs**: Ready for Claude Code reference and implementation
