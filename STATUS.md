# Hearthlink Service Orchestration Status

## Overview

This document describes the Tauri-based service orchestration implementation in `src-tauri/src/main.rs`. The Rust orchestrator manages 4 Python services with production-ready health monitoring, graceful shutdown, and automatic recovery.

## Service Configuration

### Service Definitions

The orchestrator manages 4 Python services with the following configuration:

| Service | Script Path | Port | Health Endpoint | Description |
|---------|-------------|------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Alden** | `src/api/alden_api.py` | 8888 | `http://127.0.0.1:8888/health` | AI persona assistant with memory persistence |
| **Vault** | `src/vault/vault_api_server.py` | 8001 | `http://127.0.0.1:8001/health` | Encrypted memory management and secure storage |
| **Core** | `src/api/core_api.py` | 8000 | `http://127.0.0.1:8000/health` | Session orchestration and multi-agent coordination |
| **Synapse** | `src/api/synapse_api_server.py` | 8002 | `http://127.0.0.1:8002/health` | Plugin gateway and external integrations |

### Spawn Arguments

Each service is launched with the following command structure:

```bash
python3 <script_path> --host 127.0.0.1 --port <port>
```

**Environment Variables:**
- `HEARTHLINK_VAULT_KEY`: Encryption key for Vault service (auto-generated if not present)
- `PYTHONPATH`: Set to resource directory for proper imports
- `HEARTHLINK_DATA_DIR`: Points to `hearthlink_data/` for persistent storage

**Process Configuration:**
- `stdin`: `Stdio::null()`
- `stdout`: `Stdio::piped()` 
- `stderr`: `Stdio::piped()`
- Working directory: Resource directory (bundle root in production)

## Health Monitoring System

### Two-Phase Monitoring

**Phase 1: Fast Startup Probing (First 60 seconds)**
- Interval: 5 seconds
- Purpose: Rapid detection of service startup issues
- Automatic transition to steady-state after 60 seconds

**Phase 2: Steady-State Monitoring**  
- Interval: 30 seconds
- Purpose: Long-term service health verification
- Continues until application shutdown

### Health Check Endpoints

All health endpoints return JSON with the following structure:

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "<service-name>-api", 
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "timestamp": "<iso-timestamp>"
}
```

**HTTP Success Criteria:**
- Status Code: 200 OK
- Response timeout: 5 seconds
- Content-Type: application/json

### Service Status Tracking

Each service maintains the following status information:

```rust
pub struct ServiceStatus {
    pub name: String,                    // Service identifier
    pub status: String,                  // "starting", "running", "stopped", "error"  
    pub port: u16,                       // Service port
    pub pid: Option<u32>,                // Process ID
    pub started_at: Option<u64>,         // Unix timestamp
    pub health_check_url: String,        // Health endpoint URL
    pub last_health_check: Option<u64>,  // Last successful check
    pub error_message: Option<String>,   // Last error details
    pub restart_count: u32,              // Number of restart attempts
    pub last_restart: Option<u64>,       // Last restart timestamp
    pub restart_backoff: u64,            // Seconds to wait before next restart
}
```

## Production Hardening Features

### 1. Port Conflict Detection

**Pre-flight Port Check:**
- Verifies all 4 ports (8000, 8001, 8002, 8888) are available before service startup
- Fails fast with detailed error messages if ports are occupied
- Uses `TcpListener::bind()` for accurate availability testing

```rust
fn check_port_availability(&self, services: &[(&str, &str, u16, &str)]) -> Result<(), String>
```

### 2. Service Restart with Exponential Backoff

**Bounded Restart Policy:**
- Maximum 5 restart attempts per service
- Exponential backoff: 1s → 2s → 4s → 8s → 16s → 30s (capped)
- Automatic restart on health check failures
- Reset restart count on successful health recovery

**Restart Triggers:**
- HTTP non-200 responses from health endpoints
- Network connection failures to health endpoints
- Process crashes detected during health checks

### 3. Graceful Process Lifecycle Management

**Service Shutdown Sequence:**
1. **Terminate**: Send SIGTERM to process
2. **Wait**: Allow up to 10 seconds for graceful shutdown
3. **Force Kill**: Force termination if timeout exceeded

```rust
fn graceful_stop_service(&self, service_name: &str)
```

**Process Isolation:**
- Each service runs in separate Python process
- Independent failure domains
- Resource cleanup on application exit

### 4. Error Handling and Recovery

**Health Check Error Handling:**
- Distinguishes between startup delays and actual failures
- Logs detailed error context for debugging
- Maintains service state through temporary network issues

**Process Recovery:**
- Automatic detection of crashed processes
- Clean process cleanup before restart attempts
- State preservation across service restarts

## Package.json Integration

### Verified Tauri Scripts

The following npm scripts are confirmed available:

```json
{
  "tauri:dev": "tauri dev",
  "tauri:build": "tauri build", 
  "tauri:build:debug": "tauri build --debug",
  "native": "tauri dev",
  "native:build": "tauri build",
  "native:build:msi": "tauri build --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc --bundles msi",
  "native:build:exe": "tauri build --target x86_64-pc-windows-msv --bundles nsis"
}
```

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Development with hot-reload
npm run tauri:dev

# Production build
npm run tauri:build

# Windows MSI installer
npm run native:build:msi

# Windows NSIS installer  
npm run native:build:exe
```

## Service Dependencies

### Python Dependencies

Each service requires the following core dependencies:

```txt
fastapi>=0.104.0
uvicorn>=0.24.0  
pydantic>=2.31.0
requests>=2.31.0
cryptography>=3.4.8  # Vault service only
```

### Service Interdependencies

**Core Service (Port 8000):**
- Independent service, no dependencies on other services
- Provides session orchestration for other components

**Vault Service (Port 8001):**
- Independent service, provides memory storage for all other services
- Requires `HEARTHLINK_VAULT_KEY` environment variable

**Synapse Service (Port 8002):**  
- Independent service, manages external integrations
- Can operate without other services

**Alden Service (Port 8888):**
- May depend on Vault for memory persistence
- Can operate in memory-only mode if Vault unavailable

## Monitoring and Observability

### Service Health API

**System Health Endpoint:**
- URL: Available via Tauri command `get_system_health`
- Returns overall system status and individual service details

**Service Restart API:**
- Available via Tauri command `restart_service` 
- Supports manual service restart with backoff respect

### Logging Output

**Startup Logs:**
```
✓ Port 8888 available for alden service
✓ Port 8001 available for vault service  
✓ Port 8000 available for core service
✓ Port 8002 available for synapse service
Started alden service on port 8888 with PID 12345
```

**Health Monitoring Logs:**
```
alden service is healthy
vault service is healthy
Health monitoring: Switching to steady-state mode (30s intervals)
```

**Restart Logs:**
```
vault service unhealthy (Connection refused), scheduling restart
Restarting vault service with exponential backoff
Service vault restarted (attempt 1), next backoff: 2s
```

## Security Considerations

### Process Security
- Services run with application user privileges
- No elevated permissions required
- Process isolation prevents cross-service interference

### Network Security
- All services bind to localhost (127.0.0.1) only
- No external network exposure by default
- Health checks use HTTP (not HTTPS) for local communication

### Data Security
- Vault service uses AES-GCM encryption for data at rest
- Environment variable-based key management
- Audit logging for all Vault operations

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

**1. Port Already in Use**
```
Port 8000 unavailable for core service: Address already in use
```
- Solution: Kill processes using the ports or change port configuration

**2. Python Not Found**
```
Python 3.x not found. Please ensure Python 3.x is installed and in PATH.
```
- Solution: Install Python 3.x and ensure it's in system PATH

**3. Service Startup Timeout**
```
alden service unhealthy (Connection refused), scheduling restart
```
- Check Python dependencies are installed
- Verify script paths are correct in bundle
- Check service logs for startup errors

**4. Max Restart Attempts**
```
Service vault has failed 5 times, not restarting
```
- Indicates persistent service failure
- Check service configuration and dependencies
- Review service-specific error logs

### Debug Commands

**Check Service Status:**
```bash
npm run tauri:dev
# Use developer tools to call get_system_health command
```

**Manual Service Restart:**
```javascript
// In Tauri frontend
const result = await invoke('restart_service', { serviceName: 'vault' });
```

**Port Usage Check:**
```bash
# Windows
netstat -ano | findstr "8000\|8001\|8002\|8888"

# Linux/macOS  
lsof -i :8000 -i :8001 -i :8002 -i :8888
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Resource Usage
- **Memory**: ~50-100MB per Python service
- **CPU**: Low idle usage, spikes during health checks
- **Network**: Local HTTP requests only
- **Disk**: Minimal, mainly for logging and data persistence

### Startup Time
- **Cold Start**: 5-15 seconds for all services to be healthy
- **Warm Start**: 2-5 seconds if Python is already cached
- **Health Detection**: 5-25 seconds depending on service startup time

### Recovery Time
- **Service Restart**: 1-30 seconds depending on backoff state
- **Health Recovery**: 5-30 seconds for health check confirmation
- **Full System Recovery**: 30-60 seconds in worst case scenarios
