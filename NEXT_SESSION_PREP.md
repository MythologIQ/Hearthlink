## üö® Critical Notes for Next Session

### DO NOT REBUILD
- Foundation services are **VERIFIED WORKING** - build on them, don't rediscover
- Bug reporting system is **FULLY IMPLEMENTED** - monitor and improve, don't recreate
- Alpha package is **READY** - focus on testing feedback, not repackaging

### IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES
1. **Check alpha testing feedback** using the built-in bug reporting system
2. **Monitor system performance** during alpha testing period
3. **Address critical issues** that prevent testing
4. **Prepare for beta release** based on alpha feedback

### TESTING PERIOD
- **Alpha Testing**: August 1-15, 2025 (may be in progress)
- **Target Testers**: 15-25 alpha testers
- **Feedback Collection**: Use built-in bug reporting system

## üîß Tools Ready for Next Session

### Bug Report Monitoring
```bash
# Check bug reporting API health
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/bugs/health

# View recent bug reports (when API is running)
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/bugs?limit=10

# CLI bug reporting tool ready
python scripts/bug_cli.py --help
```

### Alpha Package Access
```bash
# Alpha package location
cd /mnt/g/mythologiq/hearthlink/dist/alpha_20250801/

# Quick verification
sha256sum hearthlink_alpha_20250801.zip
