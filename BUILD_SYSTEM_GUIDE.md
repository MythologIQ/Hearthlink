# Hearthlink Build System Guide

## Windows Native Build Workflow

The Hearthlink project includes a GitHub Actions workflow for building Windows installers (MSI and EXE) from the Tauri-based native desktop application.

### Workflow Location
`.github/workflows/tauri-build-windows.yml`

### Manual Trigger (UI)
1. Navigate to: https://github.com/MythologIQ/Hearthlink/actions/workflows/tauri-build-windows.yml
2. Click "Run workflow" button
3. Select branch (supports any branch with Tauri configuration)
4. Choose Release Type: `development`, `alpha`, or `release`
5. Choose Build Target: `msi`, `nsis`, or `both`
6. Click "Run workflow"

### Automatic Triggers
- **Tags**: Pushes to tags matching `v*.*.*` (e.g., v1.3.0)
- **Main branch**: Pushes to main branch affecting Tauri files
- **Pull requests**: PRs to main affecting Tauri files

### Build Artifacts
The workflow produces:
- **MSI installer**: Windows installer package
- **NSIS EXE**: Self-extracting executable installer
- **Build info JSON**: Metadata about the build

Artifacts are retained for 30 days and include:
- Version information from `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`
- Timestamp and release type in filename
- SHA256 checksums in build logs

### Branch Support
The workflow can build from any branch containing:
- `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`
- `src-tauri/src/main.rs`
- Required Tauri icons in `src-tauri/icons/`

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ dependencies
- Python 3.11+ dependencies
- Rust toolchain with Windows targets
- Tauri CLI v2.0+

### Troubleshooting
- **Workflow not visible**: Ensure workflow file exists on main branch
- **Build failures**: Check Node/Python dependencies in requirements files
- **Icon issues**: Verify all required icons exist in `src-tauri/icons/`
- **Permission errors**: Use manual UI trigger instead of API

### Fixed Issues
- ✅ Workflow now permanently available in GitHub Actions UI
- ✅ Manual dispatch supports branch selection
- ✅ Comprehensive build validation and error reporting
- ✅ Artifact naming includes version and timestamp
